## Farming system and irrigation
- 61% harvested area of smallholders is subsistence and low-input farming system

- 24-30% harvested area of smallholders is under irrigation

- Smallholders have a higher portion of irrigated area globally, but a lower portion of irrigated area in water-scarce regions, partly because Asian smallholders account for a large part of global smallholders and they traditionally irrigate more than other regions.

## Water resources, water scarcity


- 70-80% harvested area of smallholders is in water-scarce regions

## Financial and social resources, biodiversity
- Smallholders only received 1.7% of climate finance
