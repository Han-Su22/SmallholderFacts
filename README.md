## Definition (for crop producer)

There is no standard international definition for smallholders. The smallholder definition is taken as context-dependent. Several definitions are popular among international studies. 

- 2 ha threshold: Farms less than 2 ha. Example:

https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305750X2100067X
- SDG 2.3.2 definition: Overlap of two groups for each country: the land holdings with the smallest land size and account for 40% of total farmland in the country; the agriculture producers with the lowest annual economic revenue from agriculture activities and account for 40% of economic revenues from agricultural activities in the country

- 10 ha threshold

- Farm VS plot (field, parcels): A farm may include several plots. Smallholders are often defined based on the farms, e.g. the total operated land by a holding. One farm can contain from 1 to more than 10 plots depending on the region. (FAOSTAT-Structural data from agricultural censuses provide the average number of a plot per farm for some countries). 

- Farm size always refers to operated land.

- Small livestock producer: A slightly different definition based on livestock unit in SDG 2.3.2.

- Some other items often used as equivalent to (overlapped with) smallholders: family farms; Subsistence/low-input farming. Examples:

## Number and area
- In 2010, there are 276.9 million farms from 101 countries (excluding landless), operating 2.1 billion ha of land. Among these, 213.9 million farms (77.2%) are smaller than 2 ha, operated 0.12 billion ha of land (5.7%); 1.9 million farms (0.7%) are larger than 100 ha, operated 1.5 billion ha of land (71.4%).

FAOSTAT-Structural data from agricultural censuses

- 84% of farms are smallholders, operating 12% of the land. The largest 1% of farms operate 70% of global farmland

## Food and nutrient production
- Smallholder produce 35% of global food (The below paper compare their estimations with other studies. Roughly, smallholders are estimated to produce 30% of global good across studies.)

https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305750X2100067X

- Smallholders tend to plant more fruits, pulses, roots, and tubers, while larger farms plant more vegetables, nuts, and oil crops.

## Yield
Whether smallholders have a higher yield than large-scale farms is controversial at the global scale and has been debated for decades. Smallholders may have higher yields while large-scale farms have higher output per labor. Recent studies tend to claim that smallholders have a higher yield. Here are some studies as examples:

## Farming system and irrigation
- 61% harvested area of smallholders is subsistence and low-input farming system 

https://essd.copernicus.org/articles/14/4397/2022/essd-14-4397-2022.html

- 24-30% harvested area of smallholders is under irrigation

https://essd.copernicus.org/articles/14/4397/2022/essd-14-4397-2022.html

- Smallholders have a higher portion of irrigated area globally, but a lower portion of irrigated area in water-scarce regions, partly because Asian smallholders account for a large part of global smallholders and they traditionally irrigate more than other regions.

## Water resources, water scarcity

- A higher portion of smallholders are in water-scarce areas compared to large-scale farms

(Another paper in preparation)

- 70-80% harvested area of smallholders is in water-scarce regions

https://essd.copernicus.org/articles/14/4397/2022/essd-14-4397-2022.html

- Expansion of large-scale farms creates (worsen) water scarcity for local smallholders

## Financial and social resources, biodiversity
- Smallholders only received 1.7% of climate finance

- Smaller farms have higher non-crop biodiversity at the farm and landscape scales than larger farms
