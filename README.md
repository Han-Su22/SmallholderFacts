## Definition
- 2 ha threshold:
- SDG 2.3.2 definition:
- Subsistence farming:

Some other items often used as equivelent to (overlapped with) smallholders: family farms; 

## Number


## Area


## Food and nutrient production


## Yield
Whether smallholders have a higher yield than large-scale farms is controversial at the global scale and has been debated for decades. Recent studies tend to claim that smallholders have a higher yield (but with large uncertainty). Here are some studies as examples:

Smallholders have higher yield:

Large-scale farms have higher yield:




## Farming system and irrigation
- 61% harvested area of smallholders is subsistence and low-input farming system

- 24-30% harvested area of smallholders is under irrigation

- Smallholders have a higher portion of irrigated area globally, but a lower portion of irrigated area in water-scarce regions, partly because Asian smallholders account for a large part of global smallholders and they traditionally irrigate more than other regions.

## Water resources, water scarcity

- A higher portion of smallholders are in water scarce area compared to large-scale farms

(Another paper in preparation)
- 70-80% harvested area of smallholders is in water-scarce regions
https://essd.copernicus.org/articles/14/4397/2022/essd-14-4397-2022.html
- Expansion of large scale farms create (worsen) water scarcity for local smallholders https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-28077-2


## Financial and social resources, biodiversity
- Smallholders only received 1.7% of climate finance

- Smaller farms have higher non-crop biodiversity at the farm and landscape scales than larger farms https://www.nature.com/articles/s41893-021-00699-2


## Available global database

- Gridded 5 arcmin datasets for simultaneously farm-size-specific and crop-specific harvested areas in 56 countries
